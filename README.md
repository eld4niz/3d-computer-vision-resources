# Computer Vision Resources
On this repo I'll start from Mathematics to 3D computer vision techniques

## About me
I completed two internships on Computer Vision - one at Keepface on the topic of verification and recognition, other one at University of Central Florida on the topic of Action Recognition. I was away from computer vision for the sake of money for 1 year, and currently I started to refresh my knowledge and focus on researching in new topic of 3D Computer Vision.
