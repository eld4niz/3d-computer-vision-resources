## About me
Having successfully completed two distinct internships in the domain of computer vision, the first at Keepface focusing on verification and recognition, and the second at the University of Central Florida concentrating on action recognition, I temporarily diverted my attention from the field for a period of one year in order to prioritize financial considerations. However, I have recently resumed my studies and embarked on a journey to refresh my knowledge while immersing myself in the exciting field of study 3D computer vision.
